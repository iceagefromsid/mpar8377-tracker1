Planning:
- create a single page
    - contains a large bolded text stating the name of the site (CoffeeCounter) in the center of the screen with the add a new tracker button underneath it in small italics font allowing the user to open the pop-up input menu which lets them input data.
        - the pop-up window of the add a new coffee button should contain the following: Date, Time, Location, Coffee Type, Rating (1-5).
    - have a button (a large downwards facing arrow) which scrolls the page down to see the different coffees which have previously been tracked.
        - within this part of the page which has previously added coffees, add a sort function which lets you change the order of coffees based on specific criteria (Rating High - Low, Rating Low - High, New - Old, Old - New)
        - also add a search bar near the top of the screen which lets the user search for specific keywords to find the specific coffee they are looking for.

- Pop-Up Window: chatgpt got was used alongside WS3 Schools to build the pop-up window. The prompt given was as follows "please build a pop-up window which will house the following functions:" (with the functions currently within the window.).
- Storing of Data: Generative AI was used alongside personal research to implement the storing of data and the following usage of said data. prompt = "please show me a way to store user input data and then to use it."
